Version: 1.0.2
Date: ????
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when trying to take a large screenshot with auto-zoom, caused by going below the minimum zoom allowed by Factorio.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2024-12-26
  Features:
    - Auto-zoom will now use precise zoom values to always obtain a screenshot of the target size instead of being restricted to powers of 2. For example it can zoom to x3.2 instead of x2 or x4.
      - Due to this change, the "Auto-zoom max screenshot size" setting is now "Auto-zoom *target* screenshot size".
    - Added a setting to hide clouds, fog, and space dust. Defaults to true.
    - Added a setting to always reset to "Auto" zoom when starting a new screenshot. Defaults to false.

  Changes:
    - When changing zoom level while in the middle of a selection with auto-zoom, the zoom will now be set to the closest manual zoom level from the current auto-zoom level, instead of starting at x1/32. This allows more convenient adjustments when you want a screenshot just a bit bigger or smaller than the auto-zoom.
    - When trying to take a screenshot above the Factorio hardcoded max limit (16384px), the cursor's text will become red and display "Too big!".
    - When trying to take a screenshot above the anti-aliasing max limit (8192px), the cursor's text will become yellow. Taking the screenshot will turn off anti-aliasing instead of cutting the screenshot. 
    - Default JPG quality setting is now 90 (previously 80).

  Info:
    - Now requires Factorio 2.0.16 or above.
