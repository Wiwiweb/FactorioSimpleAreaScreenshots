sas-filetype=JPEG has smaller files, PNG is higher quality.
sas-jpg-quality=The JPEG render quality as a percentage (from 0% to 100%). A lower value means a more compressed image. Doesn't do anything if you select PNG.
sas-hide-clouds-and-fog=Hide cloud shadows on the ground, fog, and also foreground space dust. 
sas-anti-alias=Render in double resolution and downscale the result. Makes things look less pixelated while keeping the resolution and filesize of the final screenshot the same, however some people report seeing scaling artefacts in some cases.\nNote: The maximum resolution with anti-aliasing is 8192x8192, screenshots bigger than this will be taken without anti-aliasing.
sas-autozoom-target-px=Auto-zoom will try to get a screenshot as close as possible to this size.
sas-autozoom-always-start=If checked, the zoom selection will always reset back to "Auto" when starting a new screenshot.\nIf unchecked, your zoom selection will be saved between screenshots, but you can select Auto again by changing your zoom all the way down (past 'x1/32').
