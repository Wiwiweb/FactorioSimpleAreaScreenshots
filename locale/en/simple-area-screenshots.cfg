sas-jpg-quality=The JPEG render quality as a percentage (from 0% to 100%). A lower value means a more compressed image. Doesn't do anything if you select PNG.
sas-anti-alias=Render in double resolution and downscale the result. Makes things look less pixelated while keeping the resolution and filesize of the final screenshot the same. However the maximum resolution allowed is lowered to 8192x8192 instead of 16384x16384.
